# [Click Here](https://mahir-neema.github.io/least-time-travel-path-project/)
This project is a web application that calculates the least time travel path between two cities. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph representation of the cities and their connections.

## Features

- Generates a random graph representing cities and their connections.
- Allows users to solve for the least time travel path between a source and destination city.
- Displays the graph with the calculated least time travel path.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Vis.js

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Mahir-Neema/least-time-travel-path-project.git
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

- Click on the "Get New Problem" button to generate a new random graph.
- Click on the "Solve" button to calculate the least time travel path between the source and destination cities.
- The graph will be displayed, showing the path in orange and any plane connections in green.
